//creating a new class called CoffeeAnnotation that inherits from NSObject and implements the MKAnnotation protocol. That last part is important: before you can use a class as an annotation, it needs to conform to the annotation protocol.

//These properties are required to be part of the class, because the protocol dictates so.
